# ResolvCI Demo Repo

This repo intentionally breaks its CI workflow by omitting `actions/checkout@v4`.

ResolvCI should:
1) Detect the failure and analyze logs
2) Fetch `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
3) Propose an inline suggestion to add `actions/checkout@v4`
4) After applying the suggestion, CI should pass
